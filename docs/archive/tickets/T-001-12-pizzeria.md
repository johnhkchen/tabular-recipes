## Context

Fill out the **Pizzeria** menu. It currently holds **22 recipes, 16 of them its own** —
the rest are borrowed from other counters, which is legitimate but does not make a menu.

Both halves of a Margherita are written — the dough and the sauce — and the pizza is not. Slices out front, whole pies to order and heroes at the back are all absent, so the counter is a sauce shelf.

The work list is `docs/gaps/pizzeria.md`, written after the whole collection was read as a set of
menus. It is ranked, most conspicuous absence first, and every dish is named the way a menu names
it. Work down it. Its "What it could not stock" section is not a to-do list: those are the items a
single table genuinely cannot express, and the reasons are given.

Two things to do before writing anything:

1. **Read `recipes/` rather than trusting the list.** The gap docs are stale in places — a pastry
   shell, two pickles, cornbread, char siu and a pâté were written after they were compiled.
2. **Check whether the dish already exists**: `ls recipes/*/<slug>.cook`. A dish that belongs to
   several counters is ONE recipe with several names in `counters:`, not one per counter. If it
   exists and only needs this counter added to it, that is an edit to a file another ticket owns —
   record it in the work artifact for T-001-18 instead of making it.

Write `.cook` files only, into whichever `recipes/<category>/` folder each dish belongs in. Use
an existing category where one fits; a genuinely new kind of thing may take a new category and
folder. Do not touch `src/` — the menu sections and the shopping aisles are T-001-17's.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **Pizzeria** shelves at least **27 recipes**, of which at least **20** name it
  and no other counter.
- The dishes at the top of `docs/gaps/pizzeria.md` are written, in that order, as far as the count
  above reaches. Anything skipped is named in the work artifact with a reason.
- `node scripts/check-recipes.mjs --labels recipes/*/<each new slug>.cook` reports ok for every
  new file, and the printed label staircase reads as a cook's verbs rather than sentence fragments.
- Every new recipe carries `title`, `category`, `tags`, `servings`, `counters` and — where
  people order it by another name — `aka`, including a form typed without diacritics.
- Every timer in every new file is named.
- Quantities are real for the stated servings, and the method is the canonical one for the dish
  rather than a shortcut wearing its name.
- Only `recipes/**` is modified by this ticket.
